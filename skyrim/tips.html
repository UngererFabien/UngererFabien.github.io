            <h3>5 tips for the best Skyrim experience</h3>

            <p>Skyrim is a great game. I played it for thousand of hours. But it's not perfect and there is so many possibilities that it's easy to get lost. So here are my five tips to help you enjoy Skyrim as much as I do and make your playing time a better experience.</p>
            
            <h4>Play without mods first</h4>


            <p>The game is really good and you don’t really need mods. Mods are only there for you to enjoy the game in a different way. There is no such thing as “the 10 mods you absolutely need”. After you’ve played the game without mods and you get bored a bit, that’s when you should think about mods. Because mods enable you to customise the game like you want. But to know what you want to change you should experiment the vanilla game first.</p>


            <h4>No cheat for Level 1 ope shit</h4>


            <p>Skyrim is not a hard game. You don’t need the best sword at level 1. Actually the best way to make the game boring is to make an overpowered character at level 1. If you explore the game and finish some quest lines you will end up with a lot of very good gears and abilities. And you will enjoy the next one with your new gear as you encounter stronger opponents.</p>


            <h4>Follow the quests</h4>


            <p>Lots of people play Skyrim for hours without finishing any questline and it’s fine. There is so much content that you don’t really need the questlines to enjoy the game. But if you want to achieve great things, kill unique enemies, explore unique places and find uniques gears, artefacts and abilities, then you need to follow the quests. There are lots of them. Speak to some characters and find some adventures that you think are interesting. Then follow the white arrow and become a real hero !</p>


            <h4>Learn to use quick slot</h4>


            <p>Going into the menu every time you need to change weapons or spells is not fun. Put your favorites weapons, potions and abilities in quick slots and learn to use them during combats. The game will become way more dynamic once you master this.</p>


            <h4>Use daily abilities</h4>


            <p>Some races, stones, gears and quests unlock abilities that you can use once a day. They are really powerful but most people forget to use them or don’t because you can’t spam it so they think it’s useless. It’s really not. A day in Skyrim is not that long, you are probably going to kill one dragon or finish one dungeon in that day. If you use those daily abilities against this dragon or the boss of this dungeon you will find the fight easier while experiencing a different way to victory.</p>
