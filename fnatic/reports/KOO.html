		<h2 id="game" class="orange">Game</h2>

		<p>
			KOO Tigers have a really safe play style. They have a better average KDA than us and only 9.4 deaths per game while we are at 11.55 deaths per game.
		</p>

		<p>
			Top laner is very important in their style. Gold share show that very well. Top get 24.1% of golds. It’s 8.6 more than jungler and 1.4 less than ADC. To compare with our style. Huni get 22.7% of golds. It’s 5.9 more than Reingnover and 2.9 less than Rekkles.
		</p>

		<p>
			They put a lot of wards during fights. It’s not rare to see a quarter of jungle recover of their wards after a fight in this area. This mean they are blind on other area and it can be a good timing to find a pick with a good rotation. Otherwise after that they are going to reward the river and next objective.
		</p>

		<h3 id="game-level1" class="orange">Level 1</h3>
		<p>
			They don’t invade since the first game where they were punished, see video. Also invade don’t fit with their very safe game style. 
		</p>

		<div style="width:640px; margin:auto">
			<iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SmkVhgxDfcY?start=644&end=690" frameborder="0"></iframe>
		</div>

		<p>
			In the BO against KT they only protected the entrances of their jungle.
		</p>

		<!-- <p>
			They move quickly to punish invade and deep warding. Even if they need to use two tp (link videos)
		</p> -->

		<p>
			Not a lot of deep warding. They usually react to your level 1 and go for symmetric deep warding or jungle cover. So assuming they are not going to swap lane (because of top investment, see early game). Depending on what we want to do we can let them blind by defending our own jungle and not allow them to do this symmetric deep warding.
		</p>

		<h3 id="game-early" class="orange">Early</h3>
		<p>
			They need to have their top laner in advance to play the style they like. So they usually do duo jungling in the top side of the map and don’t do swap lane. If top is in trouble, jungle will camp him and supp may roam. They will give first tower to the top to put him in advance or to come back.
		<p>

		<p><b>
			Supp is the biggest threat in the early game ! <a href="#stats-kp-12">Huge 70% kill participation</a> before 12 minutes ! If he move they are going for a play ! It’s very predictable so if he leave lane, punish the lane he leave but play safe on other lanes.
		</b></p>

		<p>
			They like to play vision game 2 minutes in advance on dragon and baron to catch people in the river. Consider entrance of drake pit warded at 5. But their priority stay the top laner so if he is behind the drake is let alone. For example, in 3 games of the quarterfinal where gold are even or in disadvantage of KOO or top struggle first drake of the games are all take after 12 minutes.
		</p>

		<p>
			They fall behind in early if their top fall behind. Counter gank is very efficient and easy to predict in this situation. But remember that they can play from behind ! FW win two times against them with very calm early games.
		</p>

		<div style="width:640px; margin:auto">
			<iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8nd7PClQqyI?start=862&end=892" frameborder="0"></iframe>
		</div>

		<p>
			If top is good, supp will roam and will take dragon vision around 5 minutes. They take advance in early by killing people coming to ward or create kills with supp roaming.
		</p>

		<h3 id="game-mid" class="orange">Mid</h3>
		<p>
			They have a really safe mid game. They don’t take objectives before kills or multiple back from enemy team. When they do they get punish hard. <a href="#losses">See FW games for example</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Again, baron and drake are warded one or two minutes before poping. They are more looking at picks in river than for engage.
		</p>

		<p>
			They are rarely alone in the river and they often punish teams who think they found a pick and end up against 3-5 champions. Remember, they don’t die a lot.
		</p>

		<p>
			Even if they are a very <a href="#stats-dragon">dragon focus team</a> they value mid towers more than drakes. If they get an advantage after a fight at dragon pit they will rush mid lane towers during death timers. In that case quick dragon is an option when you come back to live and they back after taking one or two towers.
		</p>

		<p>
			They don’t have a lot of defencive wards in their own jungle. focus is more on the river.
		</p>

		<p>
			Their losses at worlds are due to teamfight lost in mid game. You need to mechanically outplay them during this period in clear teamfight. It’s really difficult to make picks because they play safely. If they contest drake or siege look for the engage. Otherwise they will play the safe and long game and alway punish your mistakes.
		</p>

		<h3 id="game-late" class="orange">Late</h3>
		<p>
			If you’re in advance, don’t fall into their passive game. They are only waiting for your errors. Move from objective to objective and put a big pressure on lanes. FW win two games with great teamfight that lead to baron and towers. Wait is giving them more opportunities to punish you.
		</p>

		<p>
			A lot of <a href="#stats-egpm">resources are put on their top laner</a> so he can split push and clean side lanes quickly. Mid laner play wave clear and siege oriented champion. You will need a good rotation game to take objective in late game.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<h2 id="pos" class="orange">Positions</h2>

		<h3 id="pos-top" class="orange">Top</h3>
		<p>
			Lot of resources invested. He know his matchup and how to trade/kill in solo (when their support have a bad kill participation in early it’s because the top lane is making the plays alone). Good split pusher. If he fall behind, jungler will camp him but they don’t have great success in ganks (4/10 first blood and 3 of them with assist on support). If he is going for aggressive build it mean he want to split push and put pressure on side lanes.
		</p>

		<p><b>
			Huni need to be very careful in this matchup. He is the one with the most of death on our side and their top is very efficient with golds ! Statistically speaking even a one for one is bad news for us. Because their gold share will put their top laner in advance in mid and late game and enable split push for them.
		</b></p>

		<h3 id="pos-jungle" class="orange">Jungle</h3>
		<p>
			In 8 games he clean top side jungle starting with gromp or golem then buff and finish by wolves or raptors. Then go for 2dn buff. 6 time in 10 games he pop in front of dragon looking for scuttle crab between 3:50 and 5:40. If he don’t pop at drake at this timer, it’s because he is top lane to gank (3 time in 4). But again he is really not an efficient ganker.
		</p>

		<p>
			Exact timers at dragon’s scuttle crab: 5:07, 4:20, 5:39, 5:40, 5:42, 3:50.
		</p>

		<h3 id="pos-mid" class="orange">Mid</h3>
		<p>
			Play very passive and defensive. Things like LeBlanc TP or Ahri with Abyssal Scepter first. Don’t get much attention from jungler. He is here to farm, clear lanes and create picks. All to fit with their play style. He is a big threat in mid and late game going from 46.6% of kill participation before 12 minutes to an overall huge 74.4% kill participation. Also have a nice 7.7 KDA.
		</p>

		<p>
			His style is comparable to Rekkles who have 27.2% kill participation before 12 minutes but overall 70.3% kill participation. Both have highest overall kill participation of their team.
		</p>

		<h3 id="pos-adc" class="orange">ADC</h3>
		<p>
			Not the main carry of the team but like to put pressure on the lane. Play champions with CC to create picks. His Ashe arrow is often used to create unexpected picks and kills.
		</p>

		<h3 id="pos-supp" class="orange">Support</h3>
		<p>
			Consider this men as death in the first 12 minutes. Use is move on the map to predict where is gonna be the jungler because they move together when he roam. If he leave lane, it mean they are going for a kill somewhere. Even if he have the most deaths of his team, remember it’s not a lot and he is only the supp. Teams often get punish wasting too much to kill him while he is warding or when he engage.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<h2 id="losses" class="orange">Losses conditions</h2>
		<p>
			Their two losses against FW are interesting. In both games, top laner don’t get advantage and support could not roam. And even if they seems to be in advance in the two games FW keep golds even and find decisive teamfight where KOO derive from their safe play style. Like if a very passive early game and even situation force KOO to go for plays they are not used to.
		</p>

		<p>
			In their loss against KT it was also a decisive teamfights in mid game that turn the game. Again they derive from their safe play style. Trying to take drake while five men are alive in ennemie team.
		</p>

		<div style="width:640px; margin:auto">
			<iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nZzs077_oFM?start=3782&end=3830" frameborder="0"></iframe>
		</div>

		<p>
			Key to win against KOO seem to be in two parts. First don’t let the top laner get in advance and avoid support roaming. Pression on bot lane and counter ganks can be efficient for this first part. But counter gank is risky because fail put their top laner in a very good situation. Then in mid game, find the good engages. Not picks but clear engages and teamfights. If you can follow with a good rotation and objectives they don’t have good responses.

			I did not save all stats after quarter finals. Some of them are about overall worlds. I will mark them with *. I use them as examples for the exercise and illustrate KOO comportements when it still reflect their 10 first games.
