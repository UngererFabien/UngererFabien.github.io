		<h2 id="game" class="orange">Game</h2>

		<h3 id="game-level1" class="orange">Level 1</h3>
		<p>
			They don’t invade since the first game of world where they get punish (link video). Also invade don’t fit with their very safe game style.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the BO against KT they only protected the entrances of their jungle.
		</p>

		<p>
			They move quickly to punish invade and deep warding. Even if they need to use two tp (link videos)
		</p>

		<p>
			Not a lot of deep warding. Again ward are use to protect jungle and lanes in early levels.
		</p>

		<h3 id="game-early" class="orange">Early</h3>
		<p>
			They need to have their top laner in advance to play the style they like. So they often do duo jungling in the left side of the map and don’t do swap lanes. If top is in trouble, jungle will camp him and supp may roam. They will give first tower to the top to put him in advance or to come back.
		<p>

		<p>
			They like to play vision game 2 minutes in advance on drake and baron to catch people in the river. Consider entrance of drake pit warded at 5. But their priority stay the top laner so if he is behind the drake is let alone.
		</p>

		<p>
			Very important ! Supp is the biggest threat in the early game ! Huge 70% kill participation (link stats) before 12 minutes ! If he move they are going for a play ! It’s very predictable, if he leave lane, punish the lane he leave but play safe on other lanes.
		</p>

		<p>
			They fall behind in early if their top fall behind. Counter gank is very efficient (link to videos) and easy to predict in this situation.
		</p>

		<p>
			If top is good, supp will roam and will take vision around drake aroud 5. They take big advance by killing people coming to ward or create kills with supp roaming.
		</p>

		<h3 id="game-mid" class="orange">Mid</h3>
		<p>
			They have a really safe mid game. They don’t take objectives before kills or multiple back from enemy team. When they do they get punish hard. See FW games.
		</p>

		<p>
			Again, baron and drake are warded one or two minutes before poping. They are more looking at picks in river than for engage.
		</p>

		<p>
			They are rarely alone in the river and they often punish teams who think they found a pick and end up against 3-5 champions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Even if they are a very dragon focus team (link to stats) they value mid towers more than drakes. If they get an advantage after a fight at dragon pit they will rush mid lane towers during death timers. In that case quick dragon is an option when you come back to live and they back after taking one or two towers.
		</p>

		<p>
			They don’t have a lot of defencive wards in their own jungle. focus is more on the river. (link stats wards)
		</p>

		<p>
			Their losses at worlds are due to teamfight lose in mid game. You need to mechanically outplayed them during this period in clear teamfight. It’s really difficult to make picks because they play safely. If they contest drake or siege look for the engage. Otherwise they will play the safe and long game and alway punish your mistakes.
		</p>

		<h3 id="game-late" class="orange">Late</h3>
		<p>
			If you’re in advance, don’t fall into their passive game. They are only waiting for your errors. Move from objective to objective and put a big pressure on lanes. FW win two games with great teamfight that lead to baron and towers. Wait is giving them more opportunities to punish you.
		</p>

		<p>
			A lot of resources are put on their top laner so he can split push and clean side lanes quickly (stats to golds). Mid laner play wave clear oriented champion (link pick et ban). It fit the style with top laner who split push.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<h2 id="pos" class="orange">Positions</h2>

		<h3 id="pos-top" class="orange">Top</h3>
		<p>
			Lot of resources invested. He know his matchup and how to trade/kill in solo (when their support have a bad kill participation in early it’s because the top lane is making the plays alone). Good split pusher. If he fall behind jungler will camp him but they don’t have great success in ganks (%FB). If he is going for aggressive build it mean he want to split push and put pressure on side lanes.
		</p>

		<h3 id="pos-jungle" class="orange">Jungle</h3>
		<p>
			Really often (count on video) clean top side jungle starting with gromp or golem then buff and finish by wolves or raptors. Then go for 2dn buff (count on video). Often pop in front of dragon pit between 4:30 and 6:00 (count on video). If he don’t pop at drake at this timer, it’s because he is top lane to gank.
		</p>

		<h3 id="pos-mid" class="orange">Mid</h3>
		<p>
			Play very passive and defensive. Things like LeBlanc TP or Ahri with Abyssal Scepter first. Don’t get much attention from jungler. He is here to farm, clear lanes and create picks. All to fit with their play style. Can be a little aggressive on Viktor but otherwise he play calm. Keep an eye on his tp in early game because they used double tp to get kills that way.
		</p>

		<h3 id="pos-adc" class="orange">ADC</h3>
		<p>
			Not the main carry of the team but like to put pressure on the lane. Play champions with CC to create picks. His Ashe arrow is often used to create unexpected picks and kills.
		</p>

		<h3 id="pos-supp" class="orange">Support</h3>
		<p>
			Consider this men as death in the first twelve minutes (data avant 12 minutes). Use is move on the map to predict where is gonna be the jungler because they move together when he roam. If he leave lane, it mean they are going for a kill somewhere. When he is getting vision he is not alone. Don’t engage thinking you have a pick because they take that for an opportunity to get kills.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<h2 id="losses" class="orange">Lose conditions</h2>
		<p>
			Their two losses against FW are interesting. In both games, top laner don’t get advantage and support could not roam. And even if they seems to be in advance in the two games FW keep golds even and find decisive teamfight where KOO derive from their safe play style. Like if a very passive early game and even situation force KOO to go for plays they are not used to.
		</p>

		<p>
			In their lose against KT it was also a decisive teamfight in mid game that turn the game. Again they derive from their safe play style. Trying to take drake while five men are alive in ennemie team.
		</p>

		<p>
			They are strong opponents (obviously ...). But the key to win, looking at their losses seems to be to put top laner behind or at least not in advance. Then avoid support roaming by putting pressure on botlane or play safe when he leave the lane. Finally, find the good engage in mid game to turn the game.
		</p>

	<div class="content">
		<h2 id="stats" class="orange">Stats</h2>

		<p>
			I did not save all stats after quarter finals. Some of them are about overall worlds. I will mark them with *. I use them as examples for the exercise and illustrate KOO comportements when it still reflect their 10 first games.
