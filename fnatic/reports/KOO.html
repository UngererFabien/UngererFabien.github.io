		<h2 id="game" class="orange">Game</h2>

		<p>
			KOO Tigers have a really safe play style. They have a better average KDA than us and only 9.4 deaths per game while we are at 11.55 deaths per game.
		</p>

		<p>
			Top laner is very important in their style. Gold share shows that very well. Top gets 24.1% of gold. It’s 8.6 more than jungler and 1.4 less than ADC. To compare with our style: Huni gets 22.7% of golds. It’s 5.9 more than Reingnover and 2.9 less than Rekkles.
		</p>

		<p>
			They put a lot of wards during fights. It’s not rare to see a quarter of jungle coated of their wards after a fight in this area. That means that they are blind on other areas and that could be an interesting timing to find a pick with a good rotation. Otherwise after that, they are going to reward the river and the next objective.
		</p>

		<h3 id="game-level1" class="orange">Level 1</h3>
		<p>
			They don’t invade anymore since the first game where they were punished see video. Also invading doesn’t fit with their very safe game style. 
		</p>

		<div style="width:640px; margin:auto">
			<iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SmkVhgxDfcY?start=644&end=690" frameborder="0"></iframe>
		</div>

		<p>
			In the BO against KT they only protected the entrances of their jungle.
		</p>

		<!-- <p>
			They move quickly to punish invade and deep warding. Even if they need to use two tp (link videos)
		</p> -->

		<p>
			Not a lot of deep warding. They usually react to your level 1 and go for symmetric deep warding or jungle cover. So should assume that they are not going to swap lane (because of top investment, see early game). Depending on what we want to do we can let them blind by defending our own jungle and by not allowing them to do this symmetric deep warding.
		</p>

		<h3 id="game-early" class="orange">Early</h3>
		<p>
			They need to have their top laner in advance to play the style they like. So they usually do duo jungling in the top side of the map and don’t do swap lane. If top is in trouble, jungle will camp him and supp may roam. They will give the first tower to the top to put him in advance or to come back.
		<p>

		<p><b>
			Supp is the biggest threat in the early game ! <a href="#stats-kp-12">Huge 70% kill participation</a> in the first 12 minutes ! If he moves they are going for a play ! It’s very predictable so if he leave lane, punish the lane he left but play safe on other lanes.
		</b></p>

		<p>
			They like to play vision game 2 minutes in advance on dragon and baron to catch people in the river. Consider entrance of drake pit warded at 5. But their priority remains the top laner, so if he is behind the drake is let alone. For instance: In 3 of the quarterfinal games where KOO was behind or at the same level in terms of gold, or top struggled, the first drake of the games were all taken after 12 minutes.
		</p>

		<p>
			They fall behind in early if their top fall behind. Counter gank is very efficient and easy to predict in this situation. But remember that they can play from behind ! FW wins two times against them with very calm early games.
		</p>

		<div style="width:640px; margin:auto">
			<iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8nd7PClQqyI?start=862&end=892" frameborder="0"></iframe>
		</div>

		<p>
			If top is good, supp will roam and will take dragon vision around the fifth minute. They get ahead in early by killing people coming to ward or generating kills with supp roaming.
		</p>

		<h3 id="game-mid" class="orange">Mid</h3>
		<p>
			They have a really safe mid game. They don’t take the objectives before getting kills or multiple back from the opponent team. When they do, they get punish hard. <a href="#losses">See FW games for example</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Again, baron and drake are warded one or two minutes before popping. They are more looking at picks in the river than for engages.
		</p>

		<p>
			They are rarely alone in the river and they often punish the teams who think they found a pick and end up against 3-5 champions. Remember, they don’t die a lot.
		</p>

		<p>
			Even if they are a very <a href="#stats-dragon">dragon focused team</a>, they value mid towers more than drakes. If they get an advantage after a fight at dragon pit, they will rush mid lane towers during death timers. In that case, quick dragon is an option when you come back to live and they back after taking one or two towers.
		</p>

		<p>
			They don’t have a lot of defensive wards in their own jungle. The focus is more on the river.
		</p>

		<p>
			Their losses at worlds are due to teamfight lost in mid game. You need to mechanically outplay them during this period in clear teamfight. It’s really difficult to make picks because they play safely. If they contest drake or siege, look for the engage. Otherwise they will play the safe and long game and always punish your mistakes.
		</p>

		<h3 id="game-late" class="orange">Late</h3>
		<p>
			If you’re ahead, don’t fall into their passive game. They are only waiting for your errors. Move from objective to objective and put a big pressure on lanes. FW won two games with great teamfight that led to baron and towers. Waiting would give them more opportunities to punish you.
		</p>

		<p>
			A lot of <a href="#stats-egpm">resources are put on their top laner</a> so he can split push and clean side lanes quickly. Mid laner plays wave clear and siege oriented champions. You will need a good rotation game to take the objectives in late game.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<h2 id="pos" class="orange">Positions</h2>

		<h3 id="pos-top" class="orange">Top</h3>
		<p>
			Lot of resources invested. He knows his matchup and how to trade/kill in solo (when their support have a bad kill participation in early, it’s because the top lane is making the plays alone). Good split pusher. If he falls behind, jungler will camp him but they don’t have great success in ganks (4/10 first blood and 3 of them with assist on support). If he is going for aggressive build, it means he wants to split push and put pressure on side lanes.
		</p>

		<p><b>
			Huni needs to be very careful in this matchup. He is the one with the most important death stats on our side and their top is very efficient with golds ! Statistically speaking, even a one for one is bad move for us. Because their gold share will put their top laner in advance in mid and late game and enable split push for them.
		</b></p>

		<h3 id="pos-jungle" class="orange">Jungle</h3>
		<p>
			In 8 games he cleaned top side jungle starting with gromp or golem then buff and finished by wolves or raptors. Then went for the 2dn buff. 6 times in 10 games he popped in front of the dragon looking for scuttle crab between 3:50 and 5:40. If he doesn’t pop at drake at this timer, it’s because he is top lane to gank (3 time in 4). But again he is really not an efficient ganker.
		</p>

		<p>
			Exact timers at dragon’s scuttle crab: 5:07, 4:20, 5:39, 5:40, 5:42, 3:50.
		</p>

		<h3 id="pos-mid" class="orange">Mid</h3>
		<p>
			Plays very passive and defensive. Things like LeBlanc TP or Ahri with Abyssal Scepter first. Don’t get much attention from jungler. He is here to farm, clear lanes and to create picks. All to fit with their play style. He is a big threat in mid and late game going from 46.6% of kill participation before 12 minutes to an overall huge 74.4% kill participation. Also have a nice 7.7 KDA.
		</p>

		<p>
			His style is comparable to Rekkles who has 27.2% kill participation in the first 12 minutes but 70.3% of kill participation overall. Both have the highest overall kill participation of their team.
		</p>

		<h3 id="pos-adc" class="orange">ADC</h3>
		<p>
			Not the main carry of the team but likes to put pressure on the lane. Plays champions with CC to create picks. His Ashe arrow is often used to create unexpected picks and kills.
		</p>

		<h3 id="pos-supp" class="orange">Support</h3>
		<p>
			Consider this man as the death in the first 12 minutes (data avant 12 minutes). Watch the way he moves on the map to predict where is gonna be the jungler, because they move together when he roams. If he leaves the lane, that means they are going for a kill somewhere. Even if he has the most deaths of his team, remember it’s not a lot and he is only the supp. Teams often get punished wasting too much resources to kill him while he is warding or when he’s engaging.
		</p>

	<div class="content">
		<h2 id="losses" class="orange">Losses conditions</h2>
		<p>
			Their two losses against FW are interesting. In both games, top laner doesn’t get advantage and support could not roam. And even if they seem to get ahead in the first two games, FW keeps maintain the same level of gold and finds decisive teamfight where KOO players derive from their safe play style. That’s like if a very passive early game and balanced situation forces KOO to go for plays they are not used to.
		</p>

		<p>
			In their loss against KT, it was also a decisive teamfight in mid game that turned the game. Again they derived from their safe play style. Trying to take drake while five men were alive in the enemy team.
		</p>

		<div style="width:640px; margin:auto">
			<iframe id="ytplayer" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nZzs077_oFM?start=3782&end=3830" frameborder="0"></iframe>
		</div>

		<p>
			The key to win against KOO seems to be in two parts. First don’t let the top laner get in advance and avoid support roaming. Pression on bot lane and counter ganks can be efficient for this first part. But counter gank is risky because failing would put their top laner in a very good situation. Then in mid game, find the good engages. Not picks but clear engages and teamfight. If you can follow with a good rotation and objectives they don’t have good responses.
