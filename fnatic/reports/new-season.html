		<h1 class="orange">New Season</h1>

		<h2 class="orange">Masteries</h2>
		<p>
			First of all there's a lot to learn about the new masteries. A lot of champions have huge win rate difference in solo queue depending on their masteries. For example, if you take Mundo. He has a 54.55% win rate in Platinium+Ranked at the moment. But most frequent masteries with Mundo have 59.86% win rate. With two masteries change, not even keys ones, it goes up to 66.66%.
		</p>

		<p>
			Also, it seems that people want to try things with the new masteries. Like Sora, surely because of the masteries that buff her heal. She is in 12.45% of games with a 56.48% ban rate ! But the champion doesn’t have as much success in the rift as Janna and Sona. Soraka 52.28% win rate, Sona 53.19% and Janna 53.95%. Not a really deserved success in pick and ban.
		</p>

		<div class="chart lineChart championLines line-winRate">
			<h3 class="orange">Win rate by patch</h3>
		</div>

		<p>
			So, even if masteries give ideas, there is much more data to collect before saying what masteries make some champions op. It’s not alway as obvious as Tryndamere and the crazy crit mastery of 5.22.
		</p>

		<h2 class="orange">Picks</h2>
		<p>
			In the allstars, on patch 5.22 we saw a lot of Mundo and Malphite. They both scale on HP. It’s interesting because HP items did not get a lot of modification in the patch. But they are not the only ones. There is probably a lot of other champions op in the current meta that are untested.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, in solo queue, on patch 5.23, Trundle seems to be a good counter to Mundo with 55.53% win rate against him (600+ games). It’s also a flex pick that can be played in top or jungle like Mundo. Maybe teams prefer the hard engage that Malphite is offering. Or Trundle suffers from his unpopularity. He was 5x less picked before the patch than mundo. So maybe we need 5x more time to see how op he is.
		</p>

		<div class="chart lineChart championLines line-playRate">
			<h3 class="orange">Play rate by patch</h3>
		</div>

		<h2 class="orange">Items</h2>
		<p>
			Something else we can note during the all stars is the pick of Jax. The champion has a nice distribution between AD and AP damages (Mundo and Malphite also do lot of magic damages). Maybe that explains why with the new set of AD items and price update of AP items there is not a big return of mid AD assassins. It’s easy to build around HP and armor at the moment. But Jax with his damage distribution (55.1%AD/37.3%AP/7.6True on solo queue data) is able to shut down big tanks like Malphite.
		</p>

		<p>
			Items changes seem to lead mid to more item efficient champions. Brand and Anivia are popular picks. With items like Rylai or Rod of ages + Archangel’s staff. Apparently, the synergy between items and capacities is more valuable than raw damage in the current mid meta.
		</p>

		<h2 class="orange">Rift Herald</h2>
		<p>
			The impact of this badass in win condition is difficult to estimate. In Ranked 5v5 TeamQueu he seems more impactful than the dragon or towers. First tower or dragon leads to 72.6% and 71.6% of victory (data for blue side). Meanwhile first kill on the Rift Herald leads to 75.1% of victory.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now these stats need to be used carefully. Maybe teams only kill the big munster when they have a consistent advantage and are already on their way to victory, Rift Herald or not.
		</p>

		<p>
			At the moment, in allstars games we did not see a lot of fight for this objective. It’s often taken when top laner already wins his lane to force the snowball on champion like Fiora.
		</p>

		<p>
			The buff can indeed boost top laner snowballing. But I see a lot more of way to use this buff. It’s a very early game buff that can be used to make quick win over the map. Giving the buff to jungler seems to be a good option as well. Move speed bonus is more efficient on jungler. Initiate a push anywhere on the map with the buff and number advantage.
		</p>

		<h2 class="orange">Minions</h2>
		<p>
			We don’t have any data at the moment to tell the impact of the “pushing advantage” that get minions because it’s not live yet. But the thing may be the biggest change of the new season.
		</p>

		<p>
			Minions will have a buff against enemy minions when your team has experience advantage.And the more turrets are down, the more powerful the buff is on a specific lane.
		</p>

		<div class="double" style="margin-top: -50px; margin-bottom: -50px">
			<div class="chart lineChart minion-buff-damage" style="min-height: 300px">
				<h3 class="orange">Minions damages buff (in % by level advantage)</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="chart lineChart minion-buff-deff" style="min-height: 300px">
				<h3 class="orange">Minions damages reduction buff (by level advantage)</h3>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>
			So there are some tests to do to see how the lanes will react to this buff. When is the buff powerful enough so the lane automatically push ? Is it enough to create free pressure on the map ? Does it enable the enemy team to permanently freeze the lane to deny creeps and turtle ?
		</p>

		<h2 class="orange">Turrets</h2>
		<p>
			The new turrets mechanic is interesting. Because their armor and magic resist now upgrade with time, they are easier to destroy in early game. Also, from 0 to 30 minutes, inner turrets are easier to take down than outer turrets and give a bit more golds.
		</p>

		<p>
			This new mechanic make teams really likely to snowball before 30 minutes. With a number advantage a team can easily take an inner turret. With the Rift Herald buff only one gank can lead to an inner turret. And with the minion buff this lane may be pushing as long as you keep level advantage.
